"""Journal appends must be mutually exclusive on Windows too.

Three append paths guarded on `if fcntl is not None:` with no Windows branch, so
on a Windows host they took no lock at all and concurrent writers could
interleave -- and unlike `local_store.file_lock`, which reports
`enforced: False`, nothing said the guarantee had lapsed. That silence is the
worse half: a lock that is not one still reads as a lock.

These tests pin both halves: the shared helper actually locks, and no module
reintroduces a bare single-backend `fcntl.flock` on an append path.
