"""Contracts for the tracker skills that point at Hermes' own surfaces.

Hermes records each session's tokens and cost in its own `state.db`, has its
own `/compress` with a preview form, defers tools behind tool_search, lists
its own delegate children and kanban workers, stops its own work with its own
commands, and manages skills with its own tools. These skills name those
surfaces as the source, and keep three things OMH-side:

* a usage figure is observed only from what Hermes recorded -- no row or no
  tokens is not_observed, never zero -- and provider billing stays apart;
* OMH never compresses a context and never ends a host process; the person's
  own command does, and a host action is observed only from Hermes' reply;
* an OMH-managed skill is never edited in place, since OMH regenerates it.

The runtime half (`host_usage` in `run_efficiency_report/v1`) is pinned in
`tests/test_run_efficiency.py`.
