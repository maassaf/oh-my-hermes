"""Public discovery facade for the work-artifact show-shape action tests.

The cases live in two responsibility modules that are deliberately not
``test_``-prefixed, so unittest discovery and pytest collect each case exactly
once, through this module:

- ``_work_artifact_shape_listing_cases``: shape advertisement in the copy
  listing, legacy copy compatibility, and payload immutability.
- ``_work_artifact_shape_show_cases``: show-shape rendering, unavailable
  paths, Mermaid capability gating, and privacy.
